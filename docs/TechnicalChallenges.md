# Technical Challenges & Solutions

## Lambda Processing Reliability
15% processing failures → 99.7% success rate through memory optimization and retry logic

## Citation Hallucination  
23% hallucination rate → 4.2% through confidence scoring and validation pipeline

## Multi-Format Documents
40% processing failures → 94% success rate with pdf-parse + Textract hybrid approach

## Cold Start Performance
4.2s delays → 800ms through provisioned concurrency and package optimization

## Query Performance at Scale
8s response times → sub-3s at 50K+ documents using Redis caching and Pinecone optimization

## Security & Data Isolation
Multi-tenant data separation achieved through namespace isolation, passed SOC 2 audit
